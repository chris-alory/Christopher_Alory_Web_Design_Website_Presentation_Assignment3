                        <h2>Original intent of the project</h2>
                        <p>The goal of this project is to give the shot a tennis feel. The photo has numerous pieces for
                            this, including tennis balls and a racket. The pieces will be organised in such a manner
                            that they create the impression of being after-game, simply laid on the ground and allowing
                            the light to emphasise the traditional tennis ball.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Lighting and composition</h2>
                        <p>I’ll be able to experiment with the shadows and texture of my elements due to the light and
                            composition. The objective here was to have as much natural light as possible and to
                            experiment with different versions of it depending on the hour. The reflector is employed
                            here to direct a second source of light away from the sun, erasing the shadows that have
                            formed on the ground.</p>
                        <h2>Style of photography</h2>
                        <p>The first attempts were to offer Flat lay photography, but due to a lack of space near the
                            window, I had to alter it to something more akin to commercial photography with a hint of
                            Golden Hour Photography to give the composition a warm end of day look.</p>
                        <h2>Shoot organisation</h2>
                        <p>Due to the weather and pandemic circumstances, the shooting was difficult to organise.
                            Indeed, in order to get the optimum luminosity for a golden hour impression, I had to first
                            select a sunny day. I was unlucky because I couldn’t do it outdoors since I was restricted
                            to the house, so I had to make do with what I had at home. Several tests were conducted in
                            various locations before being assigned to shoot at the appropriate time. Similarly, a
                            reflector was constructed out of cardboard and aluminium foil. I tested with other torch
                            lights as well, but without a good result. Overall, numerous photographs were shot at
                            various times of day, as well as exposure to the sun until the perfect moment was
                            identified.</p>
                        <h2>Final Edit</h2>
                        <p>Before the final result, certain changes were required.
                            First, the background and general mood were still rather gloomy and needed a minor
                            recoloring, with the warm hues matching those of the balls. As well as minor adjustments to
                            remove unwanted shadows and reflections.
                            Second, the balls themselves underwent minor contrast and shadow adjustments to enhance the
                            texture without being too saturated.
                            The overall impact is as predicted, with a pleasant mood at the finish of the tennis game
                            and a focus on the AO ball.</p>
